            Install <code>react-router-dom</code>, then wrap your application

            are considered and advanced pattern.

          <li>
            Create a component named <code>Students</code> that will display
            information about all the students. You can use the{" "}
            <code>getStudents</code> function from <code>utils.js</code> file.
            It takes a <code>number</code> parameter that represents how many
            students you want, and returns a <code>Promise</code> that resolves
            to an array of students.
          </li>
          <li>
            It should be possible to click on the name of a{" "}
            <b>single student</b> from the list in order to view the info
            regarding that specific student. The URL should be updated
            accordingly to <code>/students/{"<someId>"}</code>.{" "}

            <code>utils.js</code> file. It takes an <code>uuid</code> parameter
            and returns a <code>Promise</code> that resolves to a single
            student. This might code in handy to retrieve the <code>uuid</code>{" "}

            If the URL matches the path of your all students route, make the

            <b>BONUS/EXTRA:</b> On the students and results page, I should have
            a "Go back" button. When I click on it, it will alert me "Going back
            to the main page", and change the url back to /. This feature should
            not use a Link or NavLink.
